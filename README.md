# Fraud Detection using Graph Neural Networks

This repository implements a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based approach
for detecting fraudulent transactions in financial data.

## Overview
- Transactions are modeled as a graph
- Nodes represent entities or transactions
- Edges represent transactional relationships
- A GNN is used to learn relational patterns for fraud detection

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- PyTorch Geometric
- NetworkX
- Scikit-learn

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
